Notes about how to create different applications for Revit and Navisworks. This prossibly with the use of different languages such as python and sql
I studied civil engineering and I'm interested in the digitalization of construction. Currently I'm working as a 3D modeller with Revit for infrastructure constructions and I'm using it with Navisworks. My ambition is to develop 3D models as far as it needs to in order to make a project a model-based entity.
